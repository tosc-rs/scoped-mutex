/// Blocking mutex (not async)
///
/// Provides a blocking mutual exclusion primitive backed by an implementation of [`ScopedRawMutex`].
///
/// Which implementation you select depends on the context in which you're using the mutex, and you can choose which kind
/// of interior mutability fits your use case.
///
/// Use [`CriticalSectionRawMutex`] when data can be shared between threads and interrupts.
///
/// Use [`LocalRawMutex`] when data is only shared between tasks running on the same executor.
///
/// Use [`ThreadModeRawMutex`] when data is shared between tasks running on the same executor but you want a global singleton.
///
/// In all cases, the blocking mutex is intended to be short lived and not held across await points.
///
